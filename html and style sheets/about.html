        Hi, my name is Angus, i have been surfing for over 11 years and have
        helped many people to learn how to do it, i am very friendly and no
        question will be found as dumb when it comes to learning, this is a
        passion project of mine and i am trying to make people enjoy it to as
        much of thier ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        i only learnt how to surf much later in life, this is why i feel i can
        help people better, i grew up in maun botswana, here is where i fell in
        love with hospitality, i love to make people feel welcome, this is why i
        set up a camping adventure holiday
      </p>

      <p>
        i then pushed it further and studied hospitality management, this is so
        i could make the experiance as genuine as possible, i also have done a
        chefs course so you will be eating very well on the trip, this is great
        because surfing builds up quite an appatite, this is also one of my
        favorite coast lines in the world where we will be spoilt with the
        amount of waves all over!!
      </p>
